# Unit 2 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 2 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._
## Requirements: ##
1. Tie it to a real-world topic. Create a `README.md` ([markdown cheatsheet here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) file with an explanation of your real-world topic:
    - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc. ***OR***
    - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
2. Must use materials from, **and restricted to**, topics we've covered so far in a useful way. Specifically: 
    - Must include at least one array (either single or multi-dimensional array is fine)
    - Must include conditional (if/else, switch) statements
    - Must include at least one loop (while, for, or do-while are all fine)
    - You may use the `UtilityBelt` class (provided) to collect user input following examples shown in labs
    - You may also use anything we've learned so far from Unit 1, such as variables, static methods, etc.

## Resources: ##
-	OLI Modules + Lecture Videos - for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
-	Replit Labs - larger examples, getting inspiration for ideas
-	You are allowed to expand on your Unit 1 Programming Project as well! Or do a full upgrade on a previous lab you found interesting.

## Scoring Guide (EARN Scale): ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Exemplary** (***E***): Everything for A, plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
- **Acceptable** (***A***): Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Revision Needed** (***R***): Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. 
- **Not Assessable** (***N***): Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
